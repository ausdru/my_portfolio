          Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old adventurer with a journey that's taken me from the sunny shores 
          of Florida to the captivating landscapes of Colorado, where I've found my new home since 2019. 
          With a background as colorful as the places I've lived, I've dipped my toes into various industries, 
          including aviation, automotive, and manufacturing. From sales to administrative roles, and even stepping into management
          and supervision, I've gained a wide range of skillsets that have sculpted my professional journey to this point.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm passionately immersing myself in the world of software development at the 
          University of Denver. With each line of code I write, I'm paving the way towards becoming a proficient software developer.
          As a dedicated student, I'm on track to complete my software development bootcamp by February 25th, 2024, 
          unlocking certifications that will set me on the path to bringing my dreams in the tech industry to fruition.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Beyond the screen and keyboard, you'll find me indulging in my love for gaming. Rocket League and Rust are my go-to virtual playgrounds,
          offering me thrilling adventures and moments of pure adrenaline. When I'm not mastering the digital realm, I'm unwinding by diving into 
          captivating movies and documentaries, expanding my horizons and feeding my curiosity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Nature calls to me, and I eagerly respond with hiking boots and a sense of wonder. There's nothing
          quite like the serenity of the great outdoors to refresh my spirit and clear my mind. And while I've 
          roamed far and wide, I've got a furry companion who keeps me grounded -- Biscuit the cat, my loyal 
          and adorable sidekick.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
          In a world that's ever-evolving, I'm committed to growth, exploration, and success. From crafting 
          elegant lines of code to getting lost in the beauty of nature, I'm on a quest to live life to the fullest. 
          Join me on this exciting journey as I code, create, and conquer challenges, all while embracing the 
          joys that every moment brings.
